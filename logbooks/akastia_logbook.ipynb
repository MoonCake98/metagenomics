    "The project started as MKB (a company through KCBBE) wanted to know how the happy cups, made of PHA bioplastic, would decompose. So they wanted to see the evidence of the decomposition of the happy cups. So they studied the results of the breakdown of the microbiome. They had three test groups; soil with no addition (control), soil with PHA powder (larger surface area, faster decomposition) and soil with PHA pellets (lesser surface area, slower decomposition).\n",
    "There were little soil quality data and no significant changes in the soil quality. The changes in the soil were mostly done based on the feeling, by seeing if the plant was growing or not. All the samples were equally cared for so the only variable is the samples. The conclusion they got was that the plant growth was mostly negatively affected by PHA powder compared to the pellets. The pellets were less affecting the plant but still noticeable. This could most likely be linked to the accelerated decompose, as this changes the microbiome of the soil, and the disturbance of the plant growth. \n",

When demultiplexing barcoded rads, we can use the --discard_middle (this is always active when demultiplexing). This is useful if there is a read with a middle adapter, this means it is highly likely it is chimeric reads. Chimeric reads, are also known as split reads, which are raeds that overlaps a DNA double strand breakingpoint.\n",
